# Introduction
Welcome to the Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuux ðŸ¤¯ Android Documentation

This contains both instructions on how to use Fluxus, aswell as how developers can use it's APIs.

This is by no means a complete list of all APIs Fluxus Andrid has to offer, however it should outline a lot of the unique ones.

## Getting Started

First off, you will need an android device (preferrably a phone, the UI is inconsistent on tablets) running Android API 23 (Android 6.0) or higher.

First off, you're gonna want to download Fluxus Android & Install it onto your phone - The instructions will be provided on the download page.
*You can find Fluxus Android at [https://fluxteam.net/android](https://fluxteam.net/android/) | An installation video can be found [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1037510861369118841/1037515767429726268/2022-11-02_19-55-01.mp4)*

Once you have Roblox w/ Fluxus open, join a game & continue to [Using the Key System](Key%20System.md)
