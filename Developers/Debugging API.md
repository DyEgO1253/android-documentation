# Debugging API
> WIP | Things in here may be unimplemented or documentation may be invalid. Proceed with extreme caution.

The Fluxus Android Debugging API allows developers to more easily troubleshoot errors within scripts running on Fluxus Android.
It is not used by your end-script, but rather by an extension in your IDE.

This API will be documented once it's implemented. For now, you'll need to wait.
